- 👋 Hi, I’m @EverettPav
- 👀 I’m interested in physics, mathematics, and coding. Admittedly, it's hard to find anything I am not interested in. 
- 🌱 I’m about to be a freshman at Penn State with a major in comp sci. With that said I am still looking at my options in terms of which tech major I should go for.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ANYTHING. I just want experience in building programs.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
